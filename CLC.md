### **Critical Language Comprehension (CLC)**  

**Definition:** Critical Language Comprehension (CLC) is the ability to accurately interpret explicit verbal or written statements without distorting their meaning through implicit assumptions, cognitive biases, or unintended connotations. It encompasses:  

1. **Literal comprehension** – Understanding the explicit meaning of words and phrases.  
2. **Logical reasoning** – Correctly processing neutral, factual statements without imposing unwarranted inferences.  
3. **Pragmatic literacy** – Recognizing how language functions in specific contexts and avoiding misinterpretations based on conversational heuristics or personal expectations.  

Individuals with poor CLC may correctly recall or repeat a statement yet misinterpret its meaning due to cognitive biases, emotional expectations, or faulty reasoning. This phenomenon is distinct from simple language proficiency or vocabulary limitations, as it involves higher-order cognitive processing of language.
