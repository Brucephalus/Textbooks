# Draft: Comprehensive Malevolence Inventory (CMI)

**Instructions to Respondents**  
Below, you will see a series of statements about attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Read each statement and indicate how much you agree or disagree with it. Please respond honestly.  
- **1 = Strongly Disagree**  
- **2 = Disagree**  
- **3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree**  
- **4 = Agree**  
- **5 = Strongly Agree**

There are 12 subscales grouped into three domains. Items are arranged by subscale below, but in an actual questionnaire, they might be intermixed and randomized to reduce response bias.

---

# SCORING (Draft Concept)

1. **Sum or Average Items Within Each Subscale**  
   - Each subscale (4 items) yields a raw subscale score (range 4–20 if 1–5 scale).  
   - Higher scores indicate stronger endorsement of that trait or attitude.

2. **Calculate Domain Scores**  
   - **Domain I Score** = average (or sum) of subscales 1–4.  
   - **Domain II Score** = average (or sum) of subscales 5–8.  
   - **Domain III Score** = average (or sum) of subscales 9–12.

3. **Overall Malevolence Score**  
   - Average (or sum) across all 48 items, or average of the three domain scores.  

In practice, one might use weighting strategies or factor analysis to determine the best scoring approach. **Reverse-coded items** could be introduced for balance (not shown here) and to reduce acquiescence bias.

---

# IMPORTANT NOTES & NEXT STEPS

1. **Pilot Testing & Validation**:  
   - This scale is only a draft framework. Any real-world usage would require psychometric testing to ensure reliability and validity (factor structure, convergent validity, criterion validity, etc.).

2. **Ethical Application**:  
   - These constructs are sensitive and potentially stigmatizing. Any testing or research should be conducted with appropriate IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval, informed consent, and confidentiality measures.

3. **Potential Item Refinements**:  
   - Some items might be reworded for clarity or cultural appropriateness.  
   - Researchers might add reverse-coded items (e.g., “I often feel empathy for others’ problems”) to detect response biases and improve measurement accuracy.

4. **Scoring & Interpretation**:  
   - High scores indicate a greater tendency toward antagonistic or malevolent traits. Interpretation must be contextual and cautious.  
   - Further norming would help establish percentile ranks or cutoffs.

---

Below is a **reversed-direction** draft of the “Comprehensive Malevolence Inventory” (CMI). In this version, **disagreement** with each statement suggests a higher level of malevolent or antagonistic beliefs/traits. Conversely, **agreement** suggests lower levels. As before, this is only a conceptual draft and **has not been empirically validated**.

---

# Reversed-Direction: Comprehensive Malevolence Inventory (CMI)

**Instructions to Respondents**  
Below, you will see a series of statements about attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Read each statement carefully and indicate how much you agree or disagree with it. Please respond honestly.

Use the following 5-point scale:  
- **1 = Strongly Disagree**  
- **2 = Disagree**  
- **3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree**  
- **4 = Agree**  
- **5 = Strongly Agree**

In this reversed-direction format:
- **Disagreement** with the statements (i.e., selecting lower numbers) generally reflects **higher levels of malevolent or antagonistic traits**.
- **Agreement** (i.e., selecting higher numbers) reflects **lower levels of these traits**—that is, more prosocial attitudes.

*(Note: In practice, items would typically be randomized rather than grouped by subscale.)*

---

# SCORING (DRAFT)

1. **Reverse Coding**  
   - Because **disagreement** (low ratings) now indicates more malevolence, each item is scored **inversely**.  
   - For a standard 1–5 scale, you can transform item scores so that:  
     \[
     \text{Transformed Score} = 6 - \text{Raw Score}
     \]  
   - Thus, if someone chooses **1 (Strongly Disagree)** on an item, it becomes a **5** (indicating higher malevolence). If someone chooses **5 (Strongly Agree)**, it becomes a **1** (indicating lower malevolence).

2. **Subscale Scores**  
   - Each 4-item subscale is summed or averaged **after** reverse-coding.  
   - Higher subscale scores mean higher levels of the malevolent trait (e.g., Machiavellianism, callousness, etc.).

3. **Domain Scores**  
   - Sum or average each group of subscales:  
     - **Domain I** = subscales 1–4  
     - **Domain II** = subscales 5–8  
     - **Domain III** = subscales 9–12  
   - Again, use reverse-coded values.

4. **Overall “Malevolence” Score**  
   - Optionally, aggregate (sum or average) all 48 reverse-coded items to get a global measure.  
   - A higher total means a stronger overall malevolent disposition.

---

## Important Caveats & Next Steps

1. **Pilot Testing & Validation**  
   - The above statements are purely illustrative. Real-world usage requires formal psychometric testing—item analysis, factor analysis, convergent and discriminant validity checks, etc.

2. **Ethical Use**  
   - Because these constructs can be stigmatizing, any research or assessment must be done with proper ethical oversight (IRB approval, confidentiality, etc.).

3. **Balancing Response Bias**  
   - In practice, one might still include some normally keyed items (where agreement signals higher malevolence) to balance the scale and reduce predictable response patterns. This draft reverses **all** items for clarity, but a mixed approach is common in validated instruments.

4. **Contextual Interpretation**  
   - Higher scores indicate more antagonistic, manipulative, or rigid traits, but context and nuance matter. Use caution in labeling or making decisions based on these results.

---



---

## Rationale for a Social Desirability Subscale

1. **Motivation to Self-Present**  
   - Many antagonistic or malevolent traits are socially undesirable. Test-takers who score high on these dimensions may be more motivated to distort responses and appear more “normal” or prosocial.

2. **Impression Management vs. Self-Deception**  
   - Social desirability can manifest as **intentional deception** (impression management) or **genuine but overly positive self-views** (self-deception). In either case, elevated social desirability scores raise caution about the veracity of other responses.

3. **Practical Utility**  
   - A social desirability subscale can’t prove someone is lying, but if they score unusually high, interpret the main malevolence results with extra caution.  
   - Some researchers remove participants with extreme social desirability scores from analyses or, at minimum, note that their data may be suspect.

---

## Sample Social Desirability (“Lie”) Items

Below are sample items. Like the main test, they can be rated on a **1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree)** scale. Typically, **agreement** on highly virtuous or nearly impossible statements indicates potential deception.

1. **“I have never told a single lie in my entire life.”**  
2. **“I always do the right thing, no matter how inconvenient.”**  
3. **“I have never felt jealous or resentful about another person’s success.”**  
4. **“I always treat everyone around me with perfect kindness and patience.”**  
5. **“I have never raised my voice at anyone, even when upset.”**  
6. **“I never experience doubts about my moral choices.”**  
7. **“I have never done anything I regret, not even once.”**  
8. **“I have always kept every promise I have made, in any situation.”**

### Reverse-Keyed Variations  
- You may also include a couple of “negative” items to reduce response patterns, for instance:  
   9. **“I sometimes make small mistakes in my everyday interactions.”** (Where Disagree = Unusually virtuous)  
   10. **“Every now and then, I catch myself saying something I shouldn’t.”** (Where Disagree = Unusually virtuous)

*(If using reversed-direction for the entire malevolence instrument, you could keep these in the normal direction, or vice versa, to balance out response tendencies.)*

---

## Scoring & Interpretation

1. **Summation or Averaging**  
   - Sum (or average) the items. A high raw score suggests the respondent is claiming an unrealistic level of perfection or altruism.

2. **Cutoff Scores**  
   - There is no universal cutoff; you’d establish thresholds empirically. Typically, a standard rule of thumb might be: “Scores above the 90th or 95th percentile in social desirability should be examined more closely.”

3. **Adjustment or Exclusion**  
   - **Adjustment**: Some researchers adjust final scores on the main scales based on social desirability, though this can be controversial and requires strong validation data.  
   - **Exclusion**: In some research contexts, extremely high social desirability scorers are excluded from analyses, or their results are flagged.

4. **Interpretational Caution**  
   - A high social desirability score doesn’t automatically mean someone is lying—some individuals genuinely see themselves as highly moral or rarely introspect about flaws.  
   - Conversely, a perfectly truthful respondent might still occasionally endorse these items if they misunderstood the prompt or wanted to present themselves positively. Context and consistency matter.

---

## Practical Implementation Notes

1. **Embedding**  
   - Randomly intersperse social desirability items among the main malevolence items to make it less obvious which ones measure lying or self-presentation.

2. **Pilot Testing**  
   - Conduct item analyses and factor analyses to confirm these “lie” items form a coherent subscale separate from the malevolence factors.

3. **Ethical & Transparent Usage**  
   - Inform participants (at least broadly) that the test contains validity-check questions. Full disclosure about each item’s purpose can compromise the measure, but participants should know that the questionnaire includes methods to ensure data integrity.

4. **Integration With Existing Scales**  
   - Alternatively, you can use a well-established measure like the **Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR)** or the **Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale** instead of building your own subscale from scratch.

## DOMAIN I: Interpersonal Antagonism & Manipulation

### 1. Machiavellian Manipulation
1. **“I have no problem playing two sides against each other if it helps me.”**  
2. **“Gaining power often requires concealing one’s true motives.”**

*(Rationale: Adds more explicit references to duplicity and strategic manipulation.)*

### 2. Callousness & Lack of Empathy
3. **“People who are too sensitive need to toughen up rather than expect sympathy.”**  
4. **“I can’t be bothered with others’ emotional needs if they slow me down.”**

*(Rationale: Captures a dismissive or impatient attitude toward emotional displays.)*

### 3. Spitefulness
5. **“If a rival succeeds, I feel a strong urge to undercut them—whatever the cost.”**  
6. **“I’d make sure someone who wronged me never forgets it, even if I lose in the process.”**

*(Rationale: Emphasizes the desire to retaliate and maintain grudges.)*

### 4. Aggression & Violence Proneness
7. **“I feel a rush of excitement when I think about taking physical revenge.”**  
8. **“Making someone fear you is sometimes the quickest way to end an argument.”**

*(Rationale: Explicitly references emotional arousal from the prospect of violence and aggression as a conflict tactic.)*

---

## DOMAIN II: Intrapersonal Grandiosity & Disinhibition

### 5. Narcissistic Grandiosity
9. **“I can tell when people admire me, and I find it entirely justified.”**  
10. **“I often think my ideas are superior, and it frustrates me when others don’t see it.”**

*(Rationale: Focuses on the respondent’s sense of inherent superiority and entitlement to admiration.)*

### 6. Psychopathic Boldness & Impulsivity
11. **“High-stakes risks are thrilling to me, regardless of potential harm.”**  
12. **“I rarely regret my actions, even if I acted without thinking.”**

*(Rationale: Further highlights sensation-seeking and lack of remorse.)*

### 7. Sadistic Tendencies
13. **“I get a thrill from seeing a person who’s upset continue to suffer.”**  
14. **“When someone I dislike is in pain, I feel they’re getting what they deserve.”**

*(Rationale: Taps into both active enjoyment and a sense of moral justification for others’ suffering.)*

### 8. Moral Disengagement
15. **“If achieving my goals causes a few casualties, that’s just the price of success.”**  
16. **“I can always come up with a reason why what I did wasn’t really wrong.”**

*(Rationale: Illustrates rationalization of harm and an ability to sidestep guilt.)*

---

## DOMAIN III: Ideological Rigidity & Authoritarian Outlook

### 9. Right-Wing Authoritarianism
17. **“Obeying strict leaders is essential for keeping our society from collapsing.”**  
18. **“Criticism of traditional values often leads to moral decay.”**

*(Rationale: Strong statements reinforcing the belief that authority and tradition must be preserved at all costs.)*

### 10. Sexism & Hostile Attitudes
19. **“I think certain household or job duties belong to men or women exclusively.”**  
20. **“Attempts at gender equality go too far and often become unfair to the dominant gender.”**

*(Rationale: More explicit references to rigid gender roles and perceived overreach of equality initiatives.)*

### 11. Dogmatism
21. **“People who question my fundamental beliefs are either ignorant or malicious.”**  
22. **“I see little point in discussing alternative viewpoints once I’ve made up my mind.”**

*(Rationale: Highlights an unwillingness to engage with dissent or reconsider established viewpoints.)*

### 12. Need for Closure
23. **“I get anxious when I’m forced to leave a problem unsolved, even if it’s trivial.”**  
24. **“If an issue isn’t settled quickly, I lose patience and push for a firm resolution.”**

*(Rationale: Taps into the emotional discomfort and impatience that arise from unresolved ambiguity.)*

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Balance & Randomization**  
   - If you incorporate these items, consider mixing them in with the original set so respondents can’t easily detect the purpose of each question.  
   - As with the original items, you can use either the “forward-scored” format (where agreement indicates higher malevolence) or the reversed format. Just be consistent with your overall design.

2. **Validation & Refinement**  
   - You might generate a larger pool of items (e.g., 2–3 times more than you need) and use statistical methods (e.g., factor loadings, item-total correlations) to whittle them down to the best-performing items.

3. **Cultural & Contextual Sensitivity**  
   - Certain items about authority, gender roles, or moral codes may require localization or tweaking to remain accurate and culturally appropriate in different settings.

4. **Adding Reverse-Keyed Items**  
   - As with all self-report instruments, mixing in some reverse-worded items helps mitigate acquiescence bias and random responding.

Below is a set of **inversed (or “reverse-direction”) versions** of the additional items proposed earlier.

---

## DOMAIN I: Interpersonal Antagonism & Manipulation

### 1. Machiavellian Manipulation
1. **“It would bother me to play two sides against each other, even if it could help me.”**  
2. **“I rarely feel compelled to hide my true motives or mislead people for personal gain.”**

### 2. Callousness & Lack of Empathy
3. **“Even when I encounter ‘sensitive’ people, I try to show empathy instead of dismissing their feelings.”**  
4. **“Even if it slows me down, I prefer to consider the emotional needs of others.”**

### 3. Spitefulness
5. **“If a rival succeeds, I choose not to sabotage them, even if envy tempts me.”**  
6. **“I avoid harming myself or others just to settle a score.”**

### 4. Aggression & Violence Proneness
7. **“The thought of physically retaliating against someone makes me uncomfortable.”**  
8. **“I avoid using intimidation or fear as a way to control a situation.”**

---

## DOMAIN II: Intrapersonal Grandiosity & Disinhibition

### 5. Narcissistic Grandiosity
9. **“I’m content with being treated the same as everyone else, rather than expecting special favors.”**  
10. **“I recognize that other people’s ideas can be just as good as—or better than—my own.”**

### 6. Psychopathic Boldness & Impulsivity
11. **“I typically think about who might get hurt before I decide to take a big risk.”**  
12. **“When I do something impulsive, I usually feel regret afterward.”**

### 7. Sadistic Tendencies
13. **“Seeing someone humiliated disturbs me, even if I don’t like them.”**  
14. **“I’d intervene to help someone in pain rather than feel any pleasure in their suffering.”**

### 8. Moral Disengagement
15. **“I still hold myself responsible if my actions end up hurting someone.”**  
16. **“I find it difficult to justify unethical behavior, even if it could help me achieve important goals.”**

---

### 11. Dogmatism
21. **“I sometimes learn valuable lessons when people challenge my core beliefs.”**  
22. **“It’s wise to stay open-minded rather than dismissing opposing viewpoints outright.”**

### 12. Need for Closure
23. **“I can tolerate situations where the final answer isn’t immediately clear.”**  
24. **“Taking time to consider multiple perspectives feels more responsible than rushing to a decision.”**

---

## How to Score in a Reversed-Direction Format

1. **Rating Scale**:  
   - Use a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree).  

2. **Interpretation**:  
   - **Agreeing** (higher numbers) suggests a more prosocial stance (i.e., lower antagonism or malevolence).  
   - **Disagreeing** (lower numbers) suggests endorsement of more malevolent or antagonistic views.

3. **Reverse Coding**:  
   - After data collection, each item’s numeric value can be transformed so that a low rating (disagreement) ends up with a **high** malevolence score. For example, if using a 1–5 scale:  
     \[
     \text{Transformed Score} = 6 - \text{Raw Score}
     \]  
   - Summed or averaged scores across the items (after this transformation) provide subscale or total “malevolence” indices.
