## Mage Class Features
As a Mage, you gain the following features.
### Level 1: Pact Magic
You have learned to cast spells. The information below details how you use the rules on spellcasting with Mage spells, which appear in the Mage spell list later in the class’s description.
***Spell Slots.*** The Mage Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Mage spells of levels 1–4. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.
For example, when you’re a level 7 Mage, you have sixteen level 2 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 2 spell.
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Mage spells. *Spellfire Flare* and *Hellish Rebuke* are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Mage levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Mage Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Mage spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 8, for example, you learn a new Mage spell, which can be of levels 1–2.
If another Mage feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Mage spells for you.
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Mage spell of an eligible level.
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Constitution is the spellcasting ability for your Mage spells.
### Level 1: Magical Recovery
At the end of a Short Rest, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
### Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing any armor or holding a shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus twice your Proficiency Bonus.
### Level 3: Mage Subclass
You gain a Mage subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Mage levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Mage level or lower.
### Level 4: Feat
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Mage levels 8, 12, and 16.
### Level 9: Free Casting
You can cast a Mage spell you have prepared without expending a spell slot. You can use this feature once and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Mage levels, as shown in the Free Casting column of the Mage Features table.
### Level 10: Mage Subclass Feature
You gain your Mage level 10 subclass features.
### Level 14: Resilient Survivor
You gain proficiency in Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws.
### Level 18: Mage Subclass Feature
You gain your Mage level 18 subclass features.
### Level 20: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.
