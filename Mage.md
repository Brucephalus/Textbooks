The Mage is a flexible, simple, generic caster. It is inspired by the Spellcaster sidekick from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and by the Spell Point system presented in the Dungeon Master's Guide (2104). It is designed to be as quantitatively powerful as a 2024 class needs to be while being as qualitatively underpowered as possible.
The class can be flavored by spell selection and subclass features.

# Level 1: Innate Spellcasting  
You gain the ability to cast spells.  
  
***Cantrips.*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Mage spell list. Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Mage cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Mage level 4, you learn another Mage cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Mage Features table.  

***Spell Charges.*** A mage uses spell charges instead of spell slots to fuel spells. You gain a pool of spell charges. You expend a number of spell charges to cast a spell at a level equal to the number of spell charges expended. You can’t reduce your spell charge total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell charges when you finish a long rest. The Mage Features table shows how many spell charges you have to cast spells of levels 1—4. The table also shows the maximum level of those spells. Even though you might have enough charges to cast a spell above this maximum, you can’t do so.

Some game features require casters to expend one or more spell slots to use that feature. A mage can meet this requirement by expending spell charges totaling the same level or higher in place of the required spell slots.

You begin with 3 spell charges at Mage level 1. Each time you reach a Mage level, the number of spell charges you have increases, as shown on the Mage Features table. You regain all expended Innate Spellcasting spell charges when you finish a Long Rest.  
For example, when you're a level 6 Mage, you have twenty-four spell charges. To cast the level 2 spell *Scorching Ray*, you must spend two of those charges, and you cast it as a level 2 spell. To cast the level 1 spell Cure Wounds*, you must spend one of those charges, and you cast it as a level 1 spell. To cast the level 1 spell *Armor of Agathys* as a level 2 spell, you must spend two of those charges, and you cast it as a level 2 spell.  
  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells.  *Armor of Agathys* and *Hellish Rebuke* are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Mage levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Mage Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than one-fifth your Mage level (rounded up), as shown in the table's Maximum Spell Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new spell, which can be of levels 1—2.  
If another Mage feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Mage spells for you.  
  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Mage spell of an eligible level.  
  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Constitution is the spellcasting ability for your Mage spells.  
  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Spellcasting Focus for your Mage spells.  
  
# Level 1: Magical Recovery  
At the end of a Short Rest, you regain expended Innate Spellcasting spell charges but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (rounded down). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
  
# Level 2: Unarmored Defense  
While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.  
  
# Level 3: Mage Subclass  
You gain a Mage subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Mage levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Mage level or lower.
Subclass features do not make the class significantly more powerful in combat. Like the 2014 Cleric, the base class contains all of the necessary combat power.
  
# Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Mage levels 8, 12, 14, and 16.  
  
# Level 6: Bonus Proficiencies  
You gain proficiency in Dexterity and Intelligence Saving Throws.  
  
# Level 10: Subclass Feature  
You gain your Level 10 subclass features.  
  
# Level 18: Bonus Proficiencies  
You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Strength Saving Throws.  
  
# Level 20: Subclass Feature  
You gain your Level 20 subclass features.
