## Mage Class Features

### Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact to gain magical powers. Its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells.

***Cantrips.*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Mage spell list. Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Mage spell list.

When you reach Mage level 10, you learn another Mage cantrip of your choice.

***Spell Slots.*** The Mage Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Mage spells of levels 1–4. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Mage spells. *Spellfire Flare* and *Armor of Agathys* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Mage levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Mage Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Mage spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 7, for example, you learn a new Mage spell, which can be of levels 1–2.

If another Mage feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Mage spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Mage spell of an eligible level.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Constitution is the spellcasting ability for your Mage spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Spellcasting Focus for your Mage spells.

### Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

### Level 2: Magical Recovery
When you finish a Short Rest, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 3: Mage Subclass
You gain a Mage subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Mage levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Mage level or lower.

*Mage subclass features should not increase the combat power of the Mage.*

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Mage levels 8, 12, 14, and 16.

### Level 9: Signature Spells
Choose four level 1+ spells you have prepared that have a casting time of an action or bonus action as your signature spells. You can cast each of them once at level 4 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Mage levels. Beginning at Mage level 15, you can cast each signature spell twice between Long Rests, and at Mage level 20, you can cast each signature spell three times between Long Rests.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your signature spells with an eligible spell you have prepared.

### Level 10: Subclass Feature
You gain your level 10 subclass features.

### Level 19: Bonus Proficiencies
You gain Proficiency in Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom Saving Throws.

### Level 20: Subclass Feature
You gain your level 20 subclass features.
