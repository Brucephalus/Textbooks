**Mage Class Features**  
As a Mage, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Mage levels. These features are listed in the Mage Features table.  
## Level 1: Pact Magic  
Through occult ceremony, you have formed the ability to cast spells.  
***Cantrips.*** You know two Mage cantrips of your choice. *Prestidigitation* and *Minor Illusion* are recommended. Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Mage cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Mage level 10, you learn another Mage cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Mage Features table.  
***Spell Slots.*** The Mage Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Mage spells of levels 1â4. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
For example, when youâre a level 13 Mage, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell*** ****Spellfire Flare*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Mage spells. *Armor of Agathys* and *Hellish Rebuke* are recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Mage levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Mage Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Mage spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than whatâs shown in the tableâs Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 7, for example, you learn a new Mage spell, which can be of levels 1â2.  
If another Mage feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells donât count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Mage spells for you.  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Mage spell of an eligible level.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Constitution is the spellcasting ability for your Mage spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Spellcasting Focus for your Mage spells.  
## Level 1: Magical Recovery  
When you finish a Short Rest, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you canât do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
## Level 2: Unarmored Defense  
While you arenât wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.  
## Level 3: Mage Subclass  
You gain a Mage subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Mage levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclassâs features that are of your Mage level or lower.  
*A mage does not need a subclass. A Mage subclass should not make the Mage significantly more powerful in combat. *  
## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Mage levels 8, 12, 14, and 16.  
## Level 10: Subclass Feature  
You gain your level 10 Mage subclass features.  
## Level 11: Innate Spellcasting  
Choose one Mage spell with a casting time of 1 Action or 1 Bonus Action. You can cast the spell three times as a Level 4 spell without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.  
As shown in the Mage Features table, you gain another Mage spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Mage levels 13, 15, and 17. You regain all uses of your Innate Spellcasting when you finish a Long Rest.  
Whenever you gain a Mage level, you can replace one of your Innate Spellcasting spells with another Mage spell.  
## Level 19: Bonus Proficiencies  
You gain proficiency in all saving throws.  
## Level 20: Subclass Feature  
You gain your level 20 Mage features.
